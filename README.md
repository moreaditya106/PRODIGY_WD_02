Stopwatch Web Application
Project Overview
This is a simple and interactive stopwatch web application built as part of my Web Development internship at Prodigy Infotech. The application allows users to start, pause, reset the stopwatch, and record lap times. It is created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

Features
Start/Stop Functionality: Users can start and stop the stopwatch with a click of a button.
Pause and Resume: The stopwatch can be paused and resumed without resetting the time.
Reset: Users can reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00.
Lap Tracking: Users can double-click on the time display to record and display lap times.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the basic structure of the application.
CSS: Used to style the application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
JavaScript: Implements the logic for the stopwatch, including time calculation, display updates, and lap tracking.

How to Use
Start: Click the "Start" button to begin the stopwatch.
Pause: Click the "Pause" button to pause the stopwatch.
Resume: Click the "Start" button again to resume from where it was paused.
Reset: Click the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00.
Lap Time: Double-click on the time display to save the current time as a lap time.
